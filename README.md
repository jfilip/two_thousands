Two Thousands
=============

This code is used to define a "database" of audio files with detailed information
about each track and then display a sortable web interface which sends playlist
data to an embedded JW Player instance in order to stream MP3 files as audio to a
user's browser.

Also allows downloading of an M3U playlist file for use on a local computer.

This was meant as a way for me to share my favourite tracks from the years 2000 - 
2009.

For an example of this, see [http://jfilip.ca/two_thousands/][1]

NOTE: MP3 files and album artwork files not included.
